## Overview

js1# is a browser-based implementation of the [1# text register
machine](http://www.indiana.edu/~iulg/trm/) used in Larry Moss's recursion
theory classes. The 1# interpreter is written in Javascript (with
jQuery/Bootstrap) and runs locally, so the whole package can work without
connectivity. The goal is simply to build an accessible and easy-to-use tool for
students working on the exercises that involve writing 1# programs.

js1# was originally written by [@rrose1] (https://github.com/rrose1/) and [@dasprunger] (https://github.com/dasprunger/).
This version adds a few new features, among which is the ability to execute a program one step at a time.
